> REDUX library: REACT and REDUX are separate libraries
> Redux offer easy debugging

> Redux provide whole large global object to store the data.
> That object is divided into the slices (small part of large object)
> Why need slice: we separate multiple slice according to logic (cart slice for cart info, user slice for logged in user info, themes slice, etc...)
> initially each slice is empty but as we put data in it, it update only that particular slice

> -------- Redux --------------
> Install @reduxjs/toolkit and react-redux
> Build our store
> Connect our store to app
> Create a slice (cartSlice)
> dispatch (action)
> read data (selector)


> While using selector. be careful to subscribe the right portion of the store.
> if you subscribe whole store then anything changes in any slice your component will be effected (performance loss)
> Redux toolkit uses immer library behind the scenes.

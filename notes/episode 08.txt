> Class Based Components

> In Class Based Components -> inherit React.Component class and have `render` method returning JSX

> Loading a class based Component means creating instance of that class.

> Each time on instance initialization, constructor is called so it is best place to define state variables.

> `this.state` is large object in which we can create multiple state variables.

> NEVER UPDATE STATE VARIABLES DIRECTLY
